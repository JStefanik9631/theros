**Current Owner:** [[Reginald]]

**Type**: Cloak (requires attunement)

**Effect:** While wearing the cloak, you have resistance to fire damage and ignore any penalties that come as a result of a target being obscured by smoke. Also, you can use it to cast the [dimension door](https://5e.tools/spells.html#dimension%20door_phb) spell as an action. This property of the cloak can't be used again until the next dawn. When you disappear, you leave behind a cloud of smoke, and you appear in a similar cloud of smoke at your destination. The smoke lightly obscures the space you left and the space you appear in, and it dissipates at the end of your next turn. A light or stronger wind disperses the smoke.

Whenever another creature hits you with an attack on its turn while you're wearing the cloak, a cloud of smoke billows outward from the cloak, which heavily obscures you and the area around you in a 10-foot-radius sphere. The smoke vanishes at the end of the turn; a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) also disperses the smoke. This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move, as well as while you're in an area of moderate or greater wind.
