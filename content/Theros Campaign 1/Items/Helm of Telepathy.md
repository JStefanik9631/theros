**Current Owner:** NA

**Type**: Helmet (requires attunement)

**Effect:** While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the [detect thoughts](https://5e.tools/spells.html#detect%20thoughts_phb) spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with [detect thoughts](https://5e.tools/spells.html#detect%20thoughts_phb), you can use an action to cast the [suggestion](https://5e.tools/spells.html#suggestion_phb) spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the suggestion property can't be used again until the next dawn.
