**Current Owner:** [[Halcyon]]

**Type**: Lyre (requires attunement)

**Effect:** You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

The instrument can be used to cast the following spells: [fly](https://5e.tools/spells.html#fly_phb), [invisibility](https://5e.tools/spells.html#invisibility_phb), [levitate](https://5e.tools/spells.html#levitate_phb), and [protection from evil and good](https://5e.tools/spells.html#protection%20from%20evil%20and%20good_phb), [stone shape](https://5e.tools/spells.html#stone%20shape_phb), [wall of fire](https://5e.tools/spells.html#wall%20of%20fire_phb), and [wind wall](https://5e.tools/spells.html#wind%20wall_phb).
