**Current Owner:** [[Halcyon]]

**Type**: Studded Leather Armor (requires attunement)

**Effect:** While wearing the armor, you can use it to cast the [phantom steed](https://5e.tools/spells.html#phantom%20steed_xphb) spell, but only as a ritual. The steed from this version of the spell has half the normal speed and takes the form of a ghostly deer with many-pointed antlers. If the steed is hit by an attack, roll a d20. On a 6 or higher, the attack misses. If the steed takes any damage, the spell ends and this property of the armor can't be used again until the next dawn.

While wearing the armor, your ranged weapon attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover when the target is using another creature as cover. Your attacks become ghostly as they pass through such creatures, only becoming real again when they reach the target.
