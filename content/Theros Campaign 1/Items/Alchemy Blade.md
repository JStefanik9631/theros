**Current Owner:** [[Corvel]]

**Type**: Shortsword

**Effect:** This sword has a glass channel running down its length. In place of a traditional pommel, it instead has an open hole designed to fit atop a typical flask or vial. While holding the sword, you can use an action to attach a flask or vial to the pommel and draw its contents into the blade; doing so changes the sword's properties based on the attached flask or vial.

- _**Acid Vial.**_ The sword deals an extra 1d4 acid damage to the first target hit by it each turn. When the target is an object that isn't being worn or carried, the acid damage is maximized.
- _**Alchemist's Fire.**_ The sword deals an extra 1d4 fire damage to the first target hit by it each turn. If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points using the sword, you can cause a different creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target to also take 2d4 fire damage.
- _**Basic Poison.**_ The sword deals an extra 1d4 poison damage to the first target hit by it each turn. The first time that the target hits with an attack that uses Strength before the start of your next turn, the damage is reduced by an amount equal to the poison damage dealt.
- _**Holy Water.**_ The sword deals an extra 1d4 radiant damage to the first target hit by it each turn. The radiant damage is doubled against fiends and undead.

You can eject and remove the flask or vial using a bonus action, destroying its contents and leaving the container empty.
