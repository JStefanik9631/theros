**Campaign History:** 

1. Met the party at [[Isoton]]. After a brief scuffle with the party, Fenres and [[Phylin]] decided to accompany the party to kill [[Phythaezea]]. 
2. Tried and failed to protect [[Phylin]] from the final attack of [[Phythaezea]]. [[Percy]] gave [[Phylin]]'s soul coin to him as a remembrance which could also be used to ask [[Phylin]] one last question. He fashioned it into a necklace that he wears. 
3. Carried [[Phylin]]'s body to the [[Pools of Lyth]] and prayed to [[Pharika]] with [[Halcyon]] to try and revive her. [[Phylin]]'s familiar appeared to them and informed them that [[Phylin]] did not wish to return due to her affliction turning her into a [[Daughter of Pharika]]. They respected her wishes and decided to not revive her. He offered his finals words to the familiar to bring to [[Phylin]], “Thank you for being one of so very few to see me for the monster I am not. I only wish you got to see the parts of me that were so much more.” 
4. The Chosen of [[Erebos]], [[Dagoth]], appeared to him, [[Halcyon]], and [[Percy]]. The Chosen was tasked with retrieving [[Phylin]]'s body as well as [[Jigrask]].
