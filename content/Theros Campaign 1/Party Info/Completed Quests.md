### The Wolves of Kapoli

1. The party was hired through the [[Adventuring Guild]] to investigate wolf attacks in the small shepherd village of Kapoli. 
2. The party investigated the local wolf cave after killing a [[Fleecemane Lion|fleecemane lion]].
3. The party found the wolf pack ran by a wolf made out of fire and one made out of lightning. After dispatching the wolves, the party found out that the wolves were granted speech by something or someone called the [[Lightbringer]]. 
4. A wolf cub that was a child of the fire and lightning wolf was recruited by the party since [[Reginald]] saw it as an omen from [[Keranos]]. 

### Order in the Court

1. The party was informed by [[Khea]] that the legendary [[Court of Orestes]] may have been opened. They were tasked with taking charcoal etchings of any ruins found. 
2. The party set out quickly to be the first adventurers there. The party did arrive first after stopping at the [[Pools of Lyth]] and meeting [[Antigonos]]. 
3. The party defended themselves against several [[Returned]] that attacked them within the [[Court of Orestes]]. The party met a pair of [[Nymph|nymphs]] that were trying to take the [[Silence of Phenax]]. The party killed one of the [[Nymph|nymphs]], and let the other go. The surviving nymph told the party that they work for [[Athreos]] and that the [[Silence of Phenax]] was an artifact of [[Athreos]]. 
4. The party returned to [[Meletis]], forgetting to take any charcoal etchings. The party received no reward.
