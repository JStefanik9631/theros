3. [[Agraforn Charel]] informed the group that he would pay heft sums of gold for any other artifacts the players can find. He told the party that he knew of 2 more artifact locations.

### A Missing Party Member

2. The party investigated, but found nothing. [[Reginald]] hired [[Brion Plainkith]] to attempt to find the cub.
3. [[Brion Plainkith]] investigated and told the party that he detected traces of transmutation, divine, and demonic magic in the tavern room. He had no further leads, but plans to keep his ears open. 

### An Impossible Cipher

1. While approaching [[Meletis]], the party saw a figure on a horse, [[Varyas]], being chased by a group of [[Returned]]. 
2. After dealing with the pursuers, [[Varyas]] was already dead. The party discovered that his golden mask had a hidden message scratched on the back that no one could decipher expect one part that mentioned the name [[Khea]]. A note was found in the pocket of one of his pursuers stating "Silence the heretic [[Varyas]]. His secrets must remain dead." 
3. The party met with [[Khea]] and she agreed to decode the mask, but it would take some time.
