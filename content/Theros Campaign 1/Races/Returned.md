**Primary Region:** [[Despair Lands]], [[Phoberos]]

**Primary Cities:** [[Asphodel]], [[Odunos]]

**Languages:** Common 

**Known Groups:** [[Anographers]], [[Gray Merchants]], [[Kakomanteis]], [[Palamnites]], [[Pseudammas]]

**General Information:**  Before becoming a god, [[Phenax]] died, passed into [[Erebos]] realm, and ultimately escaped the [[Underworld]]. His escape route, the [[Path of Phenax]], has since been employed by rare, but over the ages innumerable, individuals. These Returned find the world of the living far different from how they experienced it in life—not that they remember their lives. Although they’ve escaped from the [[Underworld]], the Returned still find themselves separate from the living, their memories lost and their unnatural states striking fear in most mortals. As a result, most Returned come to follow certain paths of behavior and gravitate toward two city-states, known as the necropoleis—cities of the dead.

Walking the [[Path of Phenax]] doesn’t restore a soul to its life. Those who return from the [[Underworld]] are hollow shells inhabited by grim and purposeless spirits. These Returned are separated from their memories, which become wandering [[Eidolons|eidolons]]. They retain their personalities and skills, but each Returned tends to be a very different being from who they once were. Their second life is theirs to do with as they please, but it’s typically a confused, cursed life, plagued by frustration, bitterness, loneliness, and melancholy. Such leads many Returned along dark paths.

The Returned are undead in the most actual sense. When they return to the living realm, they don't return to life. They need water and air but not food. The Returned form communities, experience fleeting emotions, and follow daily routines, but their existence is a shadow play, because without an identity or an ability to nurture long-term relationships, the elements of their "lives" have no weight or substance.

They aren't just thinking, speaking undead but also feeling ones. Although their lack of identity prevents long-term memory formation, they do feel emotions based on their experiences. That in turn means that their emotions tend toward darkness: frustration, bitterness, loneliness, resentment, anger, and melancholy.

When a human dies on Theros, a funerary mask of dark clay is customary, used to "frame" the identity of the deceased for [[Athreos]]. So when a mortal destroys his or her identity to leave the Underworld, that mortal must fashion a mask to stand in for it. Gold is the most common material in [[Erebos]]' realm, so it has become customary for the Returned to symbolically replace their funerary masks (and by proxy their identities) with beautifully crafted gold masks that cover their changed faces and function as surrogate, albeit flimsy, identities. These masks cover void faces.
