**Primary Region:** [[Phoberos]], [[Ashlands]]

**Primary Cities:** [[Skophos]]

**Languages:** Common and Minotaur

**Known Groups:** [[Felhide Clan]], [[Gold Horns]]

**General Information:**  Minotaurs who dwell in the badlands of [[Phoberos]] and the remote polis of [[Skophos]] are caught between two worlds. Some follow the dark god [[Mogis]], who has tyrannized them for ages untold and shown them a trail of slaughter that is all many minotaurs have ever known. Others, though, have emerged from this bloody path and found a world that welcomes those who pursue their own destinies and heroic callings.

They are barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling those of bulls. Their horns range in size from about 1 foot long to great, curling weapons easily three times that length. They often carve their horns to sharpen their edges, etch symbols of power into them, or sheathe them in bronze to prevent them from shattering during battle.

Although they aren’t evil by nature and are free to worship any god, many are raised among those devoted to [[Mogis]]’ vile whims. Myths tell that [[Mogis]] created the first minotaurs from his own followers, typically criminals and monsters of unspeakable depravity. While many groups of minotaurs still honor their villainous progenitors, others have abandoned their ancestors and moved beyond their crimes, seeking their fates in the future, not the past.

While the inhabitants of Akros and other reaches near Phoberos, the homeland of most minotaur herds, have engaged in endless conflicts with bloodthirsty minotaurs, they know there are those who forsake [[Mogis]]’ depravities. The people of [[Meletis]], [[Setessa]], and lands beyond are also generally open-minded and curious about minotaurs who wander into their lands.
