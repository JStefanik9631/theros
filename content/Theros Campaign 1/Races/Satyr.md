**General Information:**  Satyrs have a well-earned reputation for their good spirits, gregarious personalities, and love of revels. Most satyrs are driven by two simple desires; to see the world and to sample its every pleasure. While their spontaneity and whimsy sometimes put them at odds with more stoic peoples, satyrs rarely let the moodiness of others hinder their own happiness. Life is a blessing from the gods,
after all, and the proper response to such a gift, as far as
most satyrs are concerned, is to accept it with relish.

While they typically resemble humans from the waist up, Satyrs are easily identified by their goat-like horns or deerlike antlers, pointed ears and furred lower bodies. Satyrs' solid horns connect to their heads at the base of their skulls, while their legs end in sturdy hooves. Thick fur covers their bodies from the waist down, shorter at the waist and longer below the knees. Short, soft hair grows down their neck and spine, along their shoulders and on their forearms. They vary greatly in proportions, coloring and the patterning of their fur.

Most satyrs believe the other people of Theros are woefully burdened with the plague of seriousness. Satyrs scoff at the efforts of city builders with their laws and right angles, and they poke fun at philosophers with their endless theories and interminable discourse. Satyrs feel that life is to be lived and experienced with all the senses. Satyrs see the world and everything in it as a book of delights, and they want to explore every page. 

Due to their cultural emphasis on freedom, pleasure and sensuality, it is unsurprising that monogamy is rare among satyrs. Satyrs embrace and celebrate all manner of relationships and rarely label them. The distinctions between friendship, romance and sex are unimportant to satyrs, who prefer not to limit the possibilities of their various relationships.
