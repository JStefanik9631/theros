**Primary Region:** [[Meletis]], [[Setessa]]

**Primary Cities:** Nomadic

**Languages:** Common and Sylvan

**Known Groups:** None

**General Information:**  Lagonna centaurs tend to be sleek and muscular, with powerful legs built for endurance rather than speed. They usually have coats of a single color, often with a shine that can look metallic in bright light.

They travel in small merchant family bands called guri. These groups frequently trade with [[Meletis]], which provides the biggest market for their wares, but they also do business with [[Setessa]].
 
The eldest member of each guros typically leads their family. In times of discord, the heads of the guros gather to make decisions together. Other members of the guros work as traders, gatherers, packers, and scouts. A guros has several specialized roles required for success in travel and trade: a barterer, an omener, a courser, and preferably a koletra.

A barterer negotiates deals between the guros and other traders. Barterers must know the customs of other cultures and speak several different languages. An omener is an oracle who reads messages from the gods in the natural world and reveals how the immortals would have the guros travel. A courser explores new trade territory for their guros. They are expert trackers and navigators, able to venture deep into unexplored territory and unerringly return to their families. Finally, every guros tries to travel with at least one koletra, one of the mighty, well-trained warriors of the Lagonna who are said to have the blood of the first, legendary centaur heroes. Koletras are said to bring good luck to a band, but are also usually fated to die in defense of their family. Not every guros has a koletra of its own, and guri share their best warriors among each other as a sign of goodwill and a way to forge bonds.

When young Lagonna centaurs become adults, they often leave their band to travel the world on their own. This time of self-discovery, called a protoporos, can last anywhere from a few weeks to several years. The Lagonna believe that a protoporos helps young centaurs find their place in the world. An omener reads the signs of fortune before sending young centaurs on their way, guiding the first steps of their journey. While most centaurs return to the band eventually, some find their calling elsewhere. When the Lagonna tell tales of their greatest heroes, they often speak of centaurs who found their heroic destiny on a protoporos.
