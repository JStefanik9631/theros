**Primary Region:** [[Oreskos]]

**Primary Cities:** [[Tethmos]]

**Languages:** Common and Leonin

**Known Groups:** [[Ironmanes]], [[Sun Guides]], [[Swiftclaws]] 

**General Information:**  Leonin guard the shining lands of [[Oreskos]], a golden plain where even the gods rarely trespass. Prides of these nomadic, lion-like humanoids rarely interact with other peoples, having all they need in their shimmering homeland and knowing the treachery of strangers. Still, some of them wonder what lies beyond the bordering mountains and seek to test themselves in a wider world.

They tend to be tall compared to humans and move with a boldness that suggests their physical might. Tawny fur covers leonin bodies, and some grow thick manes ranging in shades from gold to black. While their hands prove as nimble as those of other humanoids, They have retractable feline claws, which they can extend instantly. This, along with their ability to produce bone-shaking roars, gives most of them an air that readily shifts between regal and fearsome. 

Other peoples often perceive them as quick to take offense, intolerant of criticism, or belligerent. The truth is that many of them simply enjoy fighting, whether verbal or physical. They take pleasure in argument, wrestling, sparring, and even battle, enjoying the opportunity to exercise their minds and bodies.

Few of them devote themselves to the service of the gods. Centuries ago, they worshiped the same gods that humans do, but after many of their prides suffered depravities at the hands of a tyrant, most leonin rejected the gods. It’s not that they deny the existence of deities; they merely see the gods as mercurial and ultimately unworthy of adoration.
