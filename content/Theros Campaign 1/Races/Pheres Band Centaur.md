**Primary Region:** [[Akros]] and [[Setessa]]

**Primary Cities:** Nomadic

**Languages:** Common and Sylvan

**Known Groups:** None

**General Information:**  Pheres centaurs typically have long, nimble legs and lean bodies, and are often marked with natural color patterns on their hide. They sometimes paint or tattoo their upper bodies to match the patterns on their lower half. Occasionally, they are born with vertical stripes on their hooves, foretelling an exciting and adventurous life.

They roam the wild lands between [[Setessa]] and [[Akros]] in small raiding herds. These herds are voluntary associations, in contrast to the family groups of the [[Lagonna Band Centaur|Lagonna]]. When necessary, several small bands join together in a larger herd to target particularly dangerous but resource-rich targets—be they humanoid traders or roving, greedy monsters. Bands also join together to defeat common threats or to hunt for game. 
 
They value physical strength, speed, and prowess in both hunting and combat. Often a band is led by the strongest and most dominant warrior, called the charger. However, some bands elevate a tactician or strategist to this venerated position. They can be brutal and greedy, but they are clever as well, and understand the value of strategic leadership. Other centaurs in their herds work as scouts, archers, warriors, and foragers. In addition, most herds contain a caller and a tromper. 

Callers are typically druids or rangers who can draw animal assistance to their herd. Callers often have one or more animal allies at their side, and can speak to animals to learn about the surrounding lands.
Trompers are the most powerful and feared warriors of the herd. Centaur legends say that when the gods first fashioned humans from the red mud of the eldest river, trompers taught them how to corner and kill prey. The story tells that, to repay this debt, humans owe the centaurs a portion of what they catch. While humans don’t recall this arrangement, they often cite it as justification for their raids.
