## Overview 

**Title:** God of Deception

**Short Description**: Phenax is the masked patron of lies and cheats. He is [[Heliod]]’s ethical antithesis, governing the spheres of gambling, deception, and betrayal. Phenax was once a mortal who was trapped in the [[Underworld]], but he learned how to forsake his identity to prevent [[Erebos]] from detecting what he was doing. He crossed back over the Rivers That Ring the World wrapped in the tattered cloak of [[Athreos]], the River Guide, who ushers the dead to their final rest. Hidden by illusion as he was, neither [[Athreos]] nor [[Erebos]] could find [[Phenax]] and bring him back.

**Alignment**: Chaotic Neutral

**Domain:** Trickery

**Symbol:** Winged Golden Mask
