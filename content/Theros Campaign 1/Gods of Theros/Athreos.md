## Overview 

**Title:** God of Passage

**Short Description**: All mortals are destined to face Athreos, the River Guide, when their lives come to an end. The god of passage ferries the dead across the Tartyx River, conveying each mortal soul to its destiny in the Underworld. For most people, Athreos embodies the greatest mysteries of existence—the terror and wonder of life’s last moment and the revelation of one’s ultimate fate in the afterlife. Athreos is no judge, though. The veiled, silent god undergoes no deliberations and makes no exceptions. The River Guide reads the truth of each soul and bears it unfailingly to its proper place in the Underworld. There is no haggling and no sympathy on Athreos’s skiff, the god having heard and denied every conceivable mortal plea.

**Alignment**: Lawful Evil

**Domain:** Death, Grave, Twilight

**Symbol:** Crescent Moon
