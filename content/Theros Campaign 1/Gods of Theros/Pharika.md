## Overview 

**Title:** Goddess of Affliction

**Short Description**: Pharika is the god of affliction and medicine, alchemy and aging. In the earliest days of Theros, Pharika seeded the world with countless secret truths—mysteries of medicine, minerals with strange properties, nexuses of magic, and the like—which she hid among [[Nylea]]'s wilds and the shadows of [[Erebos]]’ Underworld, leaving clues where mortals might find them. It isn’t altruism that drives her; she studies the innovation and suffering of mortals, deciphering in them ever greater mysteries as she treats Theros as her personal laboratory.

**Alignment**: Neutral Evil

**Domain:** Arcana, Death, Knowledge, Life

**Symbol:** Snakes
