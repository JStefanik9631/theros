## Overview 

**Title:** God of the Sun

**Short Description**: As sunlight casts out darkness, Heliod’s justice casts out chaos and lawlessness. He is the god of the laws that govern society and the laws that punish the wicked.

He also takes an interest in the bonds of family—the relationships that tie people most closely to each other.
