## Overview 

**Title:** God of Storms

**Short Description**: Keranos is the god of storms and wisdom. Merciless and impatient, Keranos is equally likely to strike out at mortals with a bolt of inspiration or a blast of lightning. To revere Keranos is to exult in the power of wisdom, clarity of purpose, and the fury of the storm. He is favored by tinkerers, inventors, and sailors as well as those seeking solutions to intractable problems. He doesn’t tolerate the company (or the worship) of fools, and he despises vapidity and indecision.

**Alignment**: Chaotic Neutral

**Domain:** Knowledge, Tempest

**Symbol:** Blue Eye
