**Ruling Body:** NA

**Primary Races:** [[Returned]]

**General Info:** 

The [[Returned]] of Odunos despise the living, feeling sparks of pleasure when they destroy whatever the living value, be it property or people. Within their city, armed [[Returned]] gangs roam the streets, quarrelling for no apparent reason. Beyond the city’s walls, undead raiders strike out, menacing the lands of [[Akros]], [[Meletis]], and [[Phoboros]]. These raids are led by the city’s de facto ruler, [[Tymaret the Murder King]], a servant of Erebos tasked with returning [[Phenax]] to the [[Underworld]]. Knowing that [[Phenax]] could disguise himself as anyone, [[Tymaret the Murder King|Tymaret]] slaughters all living souls, just to be thorough.
 
Those who would strike back against Odunos’ raiders must venture through mires corrupted by sucking bogs and necromantic horrors. Those who survive to reach the city find it heavily guarded, its towers bristling with sleepless guards and abominations of unliving flesh.

A bottomless chasm called the [[Bothros]] yawns at the north edge of Odunos. Nothing that has fallen into its depths has ever been recovered. After a successful raid, warriors from Odunos usually dispose of their spoils in the [[Bothros]]—caring nothing for their pillage. Occasionally this includes captives, forced into the pit during wordless executions.

Beyond Odunos rises a cluster of tors honeycombed by countless tombs. Few know who were originally buried in this morbid labyrinth, but the [[Returned]] care nothing for the corpses and dust. Occasionally, returned who’ve grown tired of their half-lives congregate here, waiting for a final death to claim them. Some tales claim that treasures lie amid the crypts, but others say that [[Phenax]] first emerged from the Underworld here, and his path could be retraced back into [[Erebos]]’ domain.
