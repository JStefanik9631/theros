**Type**: City

**Related Gods:** None

**Ruling Body:** Elected Monarch

**Primary Races:** [[Leonin]]

**Location:** [[Oreskos]]

**General Info:** 

Tethmos serves as the default capital for [[Oreskos]], a meeting place for the tribes, and the home of [[leonin]] leaders. Stone buildings and slender windmills jut above the plain, their pale colors and metal decorations shimmering in the light and changing color as the sun moves across the sky. Many [[leonin]] matriarchs and other wise souls retire to Tethmos to share their wisdom with all the prides. In recent years, a few non-leonin traders have been admitted into Tethmos, provoking exaggerated tales of the leonin sages and their golden city. 

Each year, on the day of the first full moon after the autumn equinox, matriarchs from all the leonin prides gather at Tethmos to select a monarch, who acts as a representative of the prides in the wider world. While terms like "queen" or "general" are often applied to this leader by outsiders, the meaning of the leonin title is closer to "speaker."
