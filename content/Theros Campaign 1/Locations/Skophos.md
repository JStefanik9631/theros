**Type**: City

**Related Gods:** [[Mogis]], [[Erebos]]. [[Keranos]], [[Purphoros]]

**Ruling Body:** Council of Warlords and Priests

**Primary Races:** [[Minotaur]]

**Location:** [[Phoboros]]

**General Info:** 

Skophos stands as a literal maze, its twisting streets carved from the red sandstone of the badlands. The walls of the maze rise as narrow buildings that serve as homes, shops, and defensible fortresses for the city’s predominantly [[minotaur]] population. Mighty stone outcroppings tower over the labyrinth, including temples to [[Mogis]] (the most prominent), [[Erebos]], [[Keranos]], and [[Purphoros]]. The fortress-palaces of tyrants, the lairs of monstrous oracles, and cavernous indoor markets also stand as destinations at the end of confounding avenues.

Priests and warlord champions of [[Mogis]] rule the city, with individuals serving as tyrants over city districts. The city’s rulers rarely meet in council, and when they do, the quarrelsome tyrants rarely find common cause or any basis for agreement. Only the priests of [[Mogis]] can force the city’s leaders to put aside their quarrels and work toward a single goal.
