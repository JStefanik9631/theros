**General Info:** 

The influence of the [[Underworld]] leaches life and colour from a peninsula south of the [[Nessian Wood]]. Here, the necropolis of Asphodel sprawls amid the bleak region called the [[Despair Lands]]. 

The [[Returned]] of Asphodel seek to be left alone with their ennui. They rarely leave the city, venturing out only when spurred by fugues of emotion or fleeting memories. The streets are dusty and rarely walked, though the windows of dilapidated hovels glimmer with the staring masks of listless Returned. [[Asphodel]] is an echo of the grim cities of the Underworld, making it a tragically ironic home for those who risked so much to escape the land of the dead.

Three ancient [[Returned]] called the [[Aphonai]] rule Asphodel. They wear simple, identical golden masks and long, drab robes, making them nearly impossible to distinguish from one another. From the Coliseum of the [[Aphonai]], a perfectly circular stone building that stands at the heart of Asphodel, the leaders listen to cases brought before them and decide on the few matters of importance to the city. Trespassers caught within the city are often brought before the [[Aphonai]] for judgment. The elder [[Returned]] never speak, rendering their judgments only in gestures.

A cabal of mages known as the [[Order of Phaios]] defend Asphodel with their magic. The mages of the order devote themselves to studying arcane mysteries that could never be unraveled in a single life. Like all [[Returned]], though, they have difficulty remembering what they learn. For this reason, the rooms of their order’s vaulted hall, the [[Stoa of Shadows]], are covered with coded engravings that collect their wisdom. While the research of the [[Returned]] rarely leads them to epiphany, some of the few living mages who have stolen into the [[Stoa of Shadows]] escape with remarkable knowledge.

Asphodel perches at the edge of a sprawling marsh called the [[Hetos Mire]]. The necropolis stands on an elevated piece of land surrounded by treacherous bogs and tangled thickets. The inhospitable territory serves the Returned as a first line of defense against any intruders. Near the southern edge of the mire stands an ages-old, crimson cypress called the [[Blood Tree]]. Color from the tree bleeds into the surrounding bog, making the swamp waters look like a charnel pit. Vicious and venomous swamp creatures are drawn to the [[Blood Tree]] and frequently drag prey into its foul midst.
