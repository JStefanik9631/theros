**Race:** [[Minotaur]]

**Gender:** Male

**Age:** ~70

**Occupation:** King

**Known History**: A wandering [[Minotaur]] claiming to be a former king of a land east of the [[Oraniad Mountains]], he states that he was cursed by [[Mogis]] and cast out by his advisors after he declared his sickly child his heir.

**Party Interactions:**
1. The party encountered him while travelling in the [[Katachthon Mountains]].
2. He was looking for an heir for his kingdom. This test involved staying in a pot and being suffocated with dirt. [[Fredrick]] decided to take the test. With the help of [[Halcyon]] impersonating [[Mogis]], [[Fredrick]] passed the test. He named [[Fredrick]] the heir to his kingdom, gave him his crown, and fled while praising [[Mogis]] for freeing him of his curse.
