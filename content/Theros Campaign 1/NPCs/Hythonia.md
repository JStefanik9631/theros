**Titles:** Hythonia the Cruel, The Champion of Affliction, The Gorgon Queen

**Race:** [[ajksdads]]

**Gender:** Female

**Age:** ~400

**Occupation:** The Champion of Affliction

**Known History:** Unlike other [[ajksdads|gorgons]], she isn't merely a collector; she's an artist. When she came to the island of [[Skathos]], the inhabitants worshiped her as an avatar of the god
[[Pharika]]. The Cultists eagerly offered themselves up to the medusa's petrifying gaze in hopes of gaining [[Pharika]]'s favor. Seeing herself surrounded by willing devotees, she formulated a cruel plan. After encouraging them to engage in wild Rituals, she began turning her followers to stone, weaving their forms to create a grisly throne made of their petrified bodies. While her victims have dwindled, tales of the [[ajksdads]] queen and the divine secrets she hoards have not. She eagerly trades the mysteries she knows, but demands a constant price: a beautiful individual to become part of her throne.
