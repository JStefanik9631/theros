**Known History:** She has a love of history and enjoys acquiring historical artwork, information, and artifacts. She is not thrilled that [[Klothys]] is a passive God that barely talks to her.  She began a "fight" with [[Varyas]] when she criticized his satirical comedyÂ _The Satyr's Half-Horn_.

**Party Interactions:** 

1. The party met her in [[Meletis]] after her name was mentioned on the golden mask of the onw deceased [[Varyas]]. 
2. At first she thought the ordeal was a prank, but after speaking with the party, she gradually began to believe them. 
3. After translating the first line of the code on the back of the mask, she tasked the party with investigating the [[Court of Orestes]] and returning with charcoal etchings of any ruins they saw.
4. The party returned without the etchings since they forgot.
5. After seeing the [[Silence of Phenax]], she introduced the party to [[Agraforn Charel]].
